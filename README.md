# This is how V Host

## Normal Mode

Your manager Mrs. Anu Rag is not a fan of the command line. She has asked you to create a website to view all the MOMs.  
Your task is to create a website to display all the MOMs inserted into the SQL database used in the previous task.
You can use PHP, Node.JS-Express or Flask to create the backend for the website.
You shouldn't use frameworks like Django or Laravel.

Dockerise the website. Host the site using `Apache` and proxy the request to the containers.  

Keep the site name as `moms.local`.

PS: You need not focus too much on the design of the website. It can be made with simple HTML and CSS. You can use Bootstrap if you are lazy to write CSS.

## Superuser Mode

- Implement a feature to login using username and password. Set default password as `superuserpass` for simplicity.
- Implement a `Remember Me` feature.
- Feature to write and save MOMs from the website.
- Feature to filter the MOMs based on `username` and `date`.

## Deadline

26th July 2021 | 11.59 pm

_NOTE: Normal mode is necessary to complete the task. Superuser mode is highly
encouraged_
